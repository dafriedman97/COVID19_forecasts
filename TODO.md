# TODO



#### Group steps

- Think of something to add/change

- Text everyone what you're going to add/change

- Add/change something 

  - Keep track of what you added/changed and what worked/what didn't

  - Email to Danny and he'll upload

    
#### What people are currently adding/changing 

- Danny: activation functions/layers to try to fix the saturation issue 

#### Possible things to add/change

- Add other data, e.g. U.S. [census stuff](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/advanced?tid=GOVSTIMESERIES.CG00ORG01)

- Log transform outcome 

- Change outcome to per-capita (requires getting population data somehow)

- Look at daily changes rather than counts

- Do things at the state level

- Add other countries

- Whatever your little heart desires

  

#### Other things that need to get fixed eventually 

- Matching by county
- PCA considering the missing columns
  - I think I'm filling in 0s right now instead of some sort of averages—probably a better way to do this
