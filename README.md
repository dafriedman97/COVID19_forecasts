# COVID19_forecasts
CS109b final project to forecast COVID19 case counts 

We attempt to use case counts by county from the [NYT](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), special Google [mobility data](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/), and Google [trends data](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) (soon).
